    <div><p style="font-size:large">CROWS (Curated Responses on Written Standards) is an <i>automated question answering service for the fifth edition of the world&#8217;s first tabletop RPG.</i></p>
    It can answer questions on the content in the <a href="https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf" target="_blank">Standard Reference Document</a>. CROWS only knows about material in this document, not all content published for the fifth edition. As a rule of thumb, stick to the three main rule books.
<br/>
CROWS is a small project, and can&#8217;t answer every question perfectly; it does best with simple trivia-style questions.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Interpreting answers:</b>
CROWS provides the top five answers for each question, where "answer 1" is the answer it has the most confidence in, and so on.
The text in bold is the phrase picked as the answer, and the surrounding text is provided for context.
The italicised titles correspond to sections of the SRD, linked above.
